In order to use the core module the following files will need to be edited and adjusted at will:

**Database**

Database configuration can be changed in:

These are basically the strategies that are used to fetch the users, it can vary depending on your properties and ways of fetching users.

The following file takes care of handling authorization, again, it can vary depending on how you are managing roles for your project so it should also be modified.
